            <h2>Why Universal Design?</h2>
            <p>According to a 2011 report on disability from the World Health Organization, 56 million Americans were identified as having a disability.</p>
            <p id="point"> This means that 20% of Americans have a disability that impairs access to websites and internet content.</p>
            <p>This number is likely to increase as had increased due to a few reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Medical Advancements: babies are surviving premature births, accident survival is higher, and so forth.</li>
                <li>Aging society: According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 40.3 million citizens aged 65 and over, which is a historical high for this age gorup.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These stats emphasize the importance of utilizing Universal Design and creating a digital world that is inclusive.</p>
            <p>Disabilities are incredibly diverse and look different for everyone. Web design needs to be able to support the whole range of functional differences. </p>
            <p>Disability may involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobility differences</li>
                <li>Vision or hearing loss</li>
                <li>Chronic illness</li>
                <li>Mental health and neurodivergence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Everyone Benefits</h2>
            <p>Features originally intended for accessibility often become mainstream because they are simply better design. Examples of these are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curbs: Curbs were originally designed for wheelchairs but are utilized by bikes, strollers, and the majority of pedestrians.</li>
                <li>Captions: These were originally designed for deaf and hard of hearing individuals but are utilized by people who are maybe in a loud environment or have a preference for captions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A similar idea has been explored in the article <em>Flourishing in the Everyday: Moving Beyond Damage-Centered Design in HCI for BIPOC Communities.</em> This article discusses the idea of creating designs that allow marginalized communities to flourish vs. survive.
            The idea of designing to solve a problem vs. designing to flourish. The key takeaway is that aiming to design for flourishing will allow the marginalized group's original struggle to be addressed as well as additional benefits. This is similar to idea of Universal Design will benefit a larger group than expected.</p>

            <h2>Legal Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Many countries enforce accessibility standads in physical spaces and digital media. In the United States this includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Americans with Disabilities Act</li>
                <li>Department of Justice Ruling for Title II of ADA which states that all web and mobile app content must meet WCAG 2.1 level AA standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In additional to legal responsibility, including accessibility and utilizing Universal Design increases customer loyalty and improves the reputation of the company. </p>

            <h2>Technology Must be Accessible</h2>
            <p>In modern society, essential services are often digital:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare portals</li>
                <li>Government services</li>
                <li>Banking systems</li>
                <li>Job applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Designing inaccessible systems means people are prevented from excercising basic rights. Universal design ensures that technology doesn't widen inequality - it helps eliminate it. </p>
