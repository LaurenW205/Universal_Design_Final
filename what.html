            <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
            <p>Universal Design aims to create a design that meets the needs of as many people as possible by anticipating how different types of users will interact with the design. 
                Universal Design was founded on the view that there are a wide spectrum of human abilities which can change over time and in different situations.
                Universal Design is an approach that not only promotes compliance but has much wider potential for improving accessibility and usability, beyond the minimum requirements enforced by law.
            </p>

            <p id="point">The goal isn't to create a "one-size-fits-all" solution. It is to create flexible designs that respond to human diversity.</p>
            
            <p>Universal Design is applicable in several areas such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Architecture</li>
                <li>Learning materials</li>
                <li>Technology and digital interfaces</li>
                <li>Transportation systems</li>
                <li>And so much more!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Principles of Universal Design</h2>
            <p>These seven principles, developed by architect Ronald Mace, guide inclusive design decisions.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Equitable Use: Design is useful and accessible to people with diverse abilities</li>
                <li>Flexibility in Use: Designs accommodate a wide range of preferences, skills, and abilities.</li>
                <li>Simple and Intuitive: Use is easy to understand, regardless of exerience, language, or cognition. </li>
                <li>Perceptible Information: Impotant information is communicated effectively. </li>
                <li>Tolerance for Error: Design minimized hazards and reduces the impact of mistakes.</li>
                <li>Low Physical Effort: Products and spaces can be used comfortably without excessive fatigue</li>
                <li>Size and Space for Use: Adequate room is provided for apporach, movement, and interaction for alll body types and mobility needs.</li>
            </ol>
